                    Notion and Obsidian are the two primary note-taking apps I've used, each 
                    with many pros and cons. Though they both share a structure that encourages 
                    page linking as a method of organizing pages, Notion is geared more towards 
                    collaboration and is more beginner-friendly, while Obsidian offers greater 
                    control and is best for those seeking something with more features.
                </p>

                    The primary features in Notion that I found to be far better than in Obsidian 
                    was the ability to sync databases across different pages and the ability to 
                    collaborate with others and publish websites easily. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, Notion lacks customizable shortcuts, and certain functions
                    like taking notes in LaTeX and using the app online are clunky at best.

                    It was taking in notes in LaTeX that was the final straw that drove me to
                    finally, properly try out Obsidian. I had tried Obsidian a long time ago,
                    but soon gave up trying to get my homepage to look the way I wanted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This time, I spent the extra effort to make my homepage as cute as possible
                    with adorable characters and a custom theme. I guess I really was just allergic
                    to a bland homepage because I still use Obsidian daily. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I do miss being able to sync databases across my pages and being able to
                    easily public my pages to the internet, Obsidian's impact on my primary use for it,
                    note-taking, made it 100% worth it. I now have two separate LaTeX addons for all
                    the shortcuts I could ever need, and being able to use normal markdown in Obsidian
                    rather than a restricted version in Notion has been such a lifesaver for quickly 
                    bashing down notes.
